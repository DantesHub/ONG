### **SwiftUI Refactor Request**

Please refactor my SwiftUI code to ensure it adheres to best practices and is as performant as possible. Specifically, address the following aspects:

1. **Performance Optimization:**

   - **Minimize unnecessary re-renders:** Use `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservedObject`, and `@StateObject` appropriately to avoid unnecessary re-renders of views.
   - **Use memoization techniques:** Where appropriate, use `@ViewBuilder`, `LazyVStack`, or `LazyHStack` to optimize large lists or grids.
   - **Optimize any expensive computations:** Move any expensive computations or side effects out of the UI layer and into computed properties or asynchronous tasks using `Task` or `async/await`.
   - **Lazy loading or on-demand data fetching:** Implement `onAppear` or `onDisappear` for views that only need data fetched or computations performed when they appear on the screen.

2. **Code Quality and Best Practices:**

   - **Ensure proper Swift typings and protocols:** Follow Swift's type-safe conventions, and use appropriate Swift types and protocols (e.g., `Identifiable`, `Equatable`) to improve maintainability.
   - **Follow SwiftUI's data flow conventions:** Adhere to SwiftUI’s `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@EnvironmentObject` to manage state and data flow efficiently.
   - **Remove any unused variables or redundant code:** Clean up any unused variables, imports, or code.
   - **Improve readability and maintainability:** Break large views or components into smaller, reusable `View` structs and name them clearly.
   - **Avoid logic in the UI layer:** Move business logic to the view model or model classes rather than keeping it inside the view body.

3. **Styling and Responsiveness:**

   - **Ensure responsive design:** Use SwiftUI's adaptive layout tools such as `GeometryReader`, `Spacer()`, `HStack`, and `VStack` to ensure your UI is responsive and works well on various screen sizes, from iPhone to iPad.
   - **Adhere to a consistent design language:** Use SwiftUI’s `modifier` system to apply styles and ensure consistency across the app.
   - **Use SwiftUI’s `DynamicType` system** to handle font sizes dynamically for different screen sizes and accessibility needs.

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**

   - **Add necessary error handling:** Ensure that `Result`, `Try`, `Catch`, or `Throws` are used for error handling in asynchronous code (e.g., network requests).
   - **Handle edge cases:** Consider potential edge cases, such as network errors or empty data states, and display appropriate error messages or fallback views.

5. **Documentation:**

   - **Add comments or documentation where necessary:** Include inline comments or documentation to explain complex logic or computations, especially in the view model or data fetching code.

### **Example Refactor Explanation:**

- **Performance optimizations:** I refactored the large `ListView` to use `LazyVStack` inside a `ScrollView` to improve performance when displaying a large number of items. I also moved expensive computations out of the `View` body into computed properties to ensure they're only run when needed.
- **State management:** I replaced manual state handling with `@StateObject` for the view model to ensure the view only re-renders when necessary. 
- **Error handling:** I added an `onAppear` modifier with `async/await` to handle data fetching asynchronously and provide graceful error handling with fallback UI when necessary.
